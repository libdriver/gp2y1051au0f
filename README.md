## LibDriver GP2Y1051AU0F

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/gp2y1051au0f/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

GP2Y1051AU0F is a dust sensor by optical sensing system. An infrared emitting diode (IRED) and an phototransistor are diagonally arranged into this device. It detects the reflected light of dust in air. Especially, it is effective to detect very fine particle like the cigarette smoke. In addition it can distinguish smoke from house dust by pulse pattern of output voltage.

LibDriver GP2Y1051AU0F is a full-featured driver of GP2Y1051AU0F launched by LibDriver.It provides the function of dust density reading and other functions. LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

### Install

Reference /interface UART platform independent template and finish your platform UART driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_gp2y1051au0f_basic.h"

uint8_t res;
uint32_t i;

res = gp2y1051au0f_basic_init();
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...
    
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    float mg_m3;

    /* delay 1000ms */
    gp2y1051au0f_interface_delay_ms(1000);

    /* read data */
    res = gp2y1051au0f_basic_read(&mg_m3);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)gp2y1051au0f_basic_deinit();

        return 1;
    }

    /* output */
    gp2y1051au0f_interface_debug_print("gp2y1051au0f: %d/%d.\n", i + 1, 3);
    gp2y1051au0f_interface_debug_print("gp2y1051au0f: dust density is %0.2fmg/m3.\n", mg_m3);
    
    ...
}

...
    
/* deinit */
(void)gp2y1051au0f_basic_deinit();

return 0;
```
